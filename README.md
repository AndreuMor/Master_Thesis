Files Required to repeat the MD simulations and the QM simulations and calculations.

This repository is divided into different folders where all the files (input and output) used to perform all the simulations as well as all the quantum chemical calculations are present so the lector will be able to reproduce each one of them. 

The scheme of the folders is the following:

- MD simulations
  - Water (simulations performed with water as solvent)
    - Concentration 1
    - Concentration 2
    - Concentration 3

  - Ethanol (simulations performed with ethanol as solvent)
    - Concentration 1
    - Concentration 2
    - Concentration 3

- QM simulations
  - Geometry Optimization
    - Multiwfn Files
  - QM simulations 1 (vacuum)
    - Multiwfn Files
  - QM simulations 2 (water)
    - Multiwfn Files
  - QM simulations 3 (30% acetonitrile)
    - Multiwfn Files

#Notes
 QM simulations: Input files for the simulations and geometry optimization is included in the output file.
